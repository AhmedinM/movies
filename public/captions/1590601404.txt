00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,117
Sir.

2
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>Uniform number?</i>

3
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,521
Uniform Number
Victor Seven Three.

4
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,057
<i>Agent Lin,</i>

5
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,059
<i>you and your men
are the best guys I have</i>

6
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,896
<i>to transfer Dr James
to a secure military base.</i>

7

<i>A breach of
the witness protection plan</i>

8
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,466
<i>may threaten regional security.</i>

9
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:36,506
Yes, sir.

10
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,639
Trust me.

11
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,822
De...

12
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,196
Devil!

13
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,101
- Get down!
- Get down!

14
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,515
Let's go.

15
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:21,129
- Give it to me.
- No, no, no, no.

16
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:22,898
You're the devil.

17
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,567
You would have never succeeded
without me!

18
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,837
Where are the lab records?
They're mine!

19
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:43,949
Goodbye.

20
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,812
Hello?

21
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,244
<i>Although
Rick Rogers' latest novel</i>

22
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:05,280
<i>has not yet been published,</i>

23
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,082
<i>the copyrights for the movie</i>

24
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:10,885

25

<i>Bids for such rights have been
coming in at shocking sums.</i>

26
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,526
<i>I've had a sneak peek
at this book.</i>

27
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,028
<i>"She is a mission herself.</i>

28
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,297
<i>"Her blood contains
all the memories.</i>

29
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,401
<i>"One day, she will find
her memories back again." Wow!</i>

30
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,142
<i>Well, we are very privileged
to welcome to the show</i>

31
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:36,377
<i>to talk about his new book,
'Bleeding Steel',</i>

32
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,646
<i>Rick Rogers!</i>

33
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:41,282
- <i>Oh, Rick! Oh!</i>
- <i>How are you?</i>

34
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,818
<i>Oh, I'm very well. Mwah!</i>

35
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,856
<i>Welcome to the show. Thank you.
Have a seat.</i>

36
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,492
<i>So we heard the main character
was a US Marine</i>

37
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,094
<i>before he died of
nuclear radiation,</i>

38
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,930
<i>but then some geneticists
bought his body</i>

39
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,967
<i>and turned him into a bioroid
with a mechanical heart.</i>

40
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,169
<i>Well, can't keep a secret
from you, can I?</i>

41
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,271
<i>Oh, there are no secrets
in this world.</i>

42
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,842
<i>Well, maybe that's so.</i>

43
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:10,112
<i>But many unknown secrets
are hidden in my novel,</i>

44
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,446
<i>so go buy the book.</i>

45
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:15,284
<i>It's the perfect synergy
of body and machine.</i>

46
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,173
Ooh, check it out.

47
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:40,244
Stop. Security check.

48
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:51,155
Turn around.

49
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,465
<i>Is my kitty here yet?</i>

50
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,271
She's on her way, boss.

51
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,374
- Next time, it's my turn.
- Sure.

52
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,568
Come here, kitty.
Come to Papa.

53
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,226
Excuse me, where are you going?

54
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,192
- Who are you?
- Shut up!

55
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,060
Where did you get
the information in your book?

56
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:47,796
Where did you
get the information?

57
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:50,035
It was my inspiration.

58
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,568
Who are you? What do you want?

59
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,440
This is your last chance.

60
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,777
Huh?

61
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:35,914
Fuck you!

62
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:01,435
Who are you?

63
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:03,771
How did you get the story
in 'Bleeding Steel'?

64
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:05,307
P-P-Please don't kill me.

65
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,308
- I bought it.
- Where's the original copy?

66
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,749
Everything you need is in there.
I just stole a story.

67
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,123

<i>A team of policemen

00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:58,562
- Who's that?
- Is that Batman?

71

72

a robbery gone wrong.</i>

<i>We have reason to believe

<i>in the events

81
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:29,810
We were attacked by a
masked man at Rick's apartment.

82
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,613
I'm sorry.

83
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:34,652

our bulletproof vests.

89
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,760
like an animal.

90
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:23,765

I've suffered.

91
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,537
Sir, we found out about
the transvestite.

92
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:33,240
He bought that costume online.
We have a shipping address.

93
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,811
Go. Do not fail me again.

94
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:38,648
Yes, sir.

95
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:37,340
- One pizza for Leeson.
- Thank you.

96
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:03,166
When I find you,
I'm gonna kill you.

97
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:10,735
Hi.

98
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,416
- Spaghetti?
- Yes, please.

99
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:32,389
- Red sauce?
- Yeah.

100
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,360
And beef soup, right?

101
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:39,928
Thank you, sir.

102
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,899
Beef soup for
the beautiful young lady.

103
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:55,309
- It's so sparkly! So shiny.
- I know!

104
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:57,280
- Sorry.
- Bitch.

105
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,718
You guys had a conflict, though.

106
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:04,019
Excuse me?

107
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:07,555
What did you say? Sorry,
I can't really understand you.

108
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:10,328
- I don't speak Chinglish.
- That's a good one.

109
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:13,798
Oops!

110
00:32:16,332 --> 00:32:18,066
Have you had a nose job?

111
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,366
What?

112
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,312
- Argh!
- I'm sorry.

113
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:07,082
Back it off, girl.

114
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,791
Hey. Go back. Get back.
Get back. Nothing to see.

115
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:21,564
Everybody get back. All of you.
All of you, guys.

116

Nancy! Nancy!

117
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,497
Are you OK?

118
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,432
Did you have another nightmare?
Drink something.

119
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:02,606
Thank you.

120
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:06,843
Did I wake you again?

121
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,645
I'm sorry.

122
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:13,247
Ever since I changed doctors,

123
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:15,683
the nightmares have got worse.

124
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:19,386
Because that's not doctor.
She's a witch.

125
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:21,455
She's not a 'witch' witch.

126
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:25,493
She's more like a guide

127
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:30,000
or a spiritualist or something.

128
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,569
OK, whatever she is,

129
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:38,105
the dreams are getting worse
and clearer.

130
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:42,009
You have them every night.
I can't take it anymore.

131
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:45,046
I've lost my weight
and I can't sleeping.

132
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:48,515
Please, Nancy,
stop going to the witch,

133
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,787
or get her fix it.

134
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,888
- Yeah. Oh, that's in.
- Good shot, bro.

135
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,622
Ooh, konnichiwa.

136
00:35:28,624 --> 00:35:30,091
Hey, look over!

137
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,625
What's your name?

138
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,629
Come on, baby.

139
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:36,564
I've been waiting for you
for ages.

140
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:39,102
Ooh!

141
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,214
Yeah! Whoo!

142
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,924
How have you been?

143
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:12,859
The nightmares are more frequent
and more vivid.

144
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:15,495
I feel like I've become
someone else in my dreams.

145
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:18,665
It takes time to heal.

146
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,269
This is stress, my dear.

147
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,004
Figments of your imagination,
nothing more.

148
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,607
But every bit of it
feels so real,

149
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,680
like I've been there
and I know all those people.

150
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,482
As if... they are leading me,

151
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:37,584
pushing me to find something.

152
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:40,220
Don't think too much.

153
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:41,724
Relax.

154
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,732
One.

155
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,270
Two.

156
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,136
Three.

157
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,656
Doctor, the subject
is rejecting

158
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:17,191
multiple organs -
they're failing.

159
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,526
We're gonna have to
give up on this one.

160
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,368
Nancy? No.

161
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,071
- Nancy?
- Help me. Please don't kill me.

162
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:33,808
- Nancy? No.
- Don't kill me.

163
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:38,279
If you kill me,
nothing can save you.

164
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,725
What the fuck?

165
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:55,263
I-I've never seen
anything like this before.

166
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,665
There's someone else's soul
inside you.

167
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:01,305
This is way beyond me now.

168
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,308
There's a man.

169
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:10,444
He is a master of hypnosis.

170
00:39:10,446 --> 00:39:12,779
He may help.

171
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:15,917
He'll be there tomorrow.

172
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:18,955
Let's see if you can see him.

173
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,075
Why did you let her go?!

174
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:44,479
She didn't tell us anything
about her dream!

175
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:47,348
The needle broke in half.

176
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,420
Rick's dead.

177
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:54,955
I have a feeling
the tapes we were selling him

178
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:57,625
got him into trouble.

179
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,395
For real!

180
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:04,665
Oh, boys. Ho!
See what we have here.

181
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:08,035
I see you come here a lot,
looking at that lame witch.

182
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:10,270
What's your name, huh?

183
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
You can't tell me but you wanna.

184
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:16,009
Really?

185
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:18,678
Now, that's my boy.

186
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,413
Aren't you, there?

187
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,350
- Let me pass.
- Oh!

188
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:25,919
So now you speak English?
How about this?

189
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,988
Pass under here.
I know you like that, huh?

190
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:33,196
Get that bitch.

191
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,527
Whoo! Come on, boys.
We've got some fresh meat.

192
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,562
- Where you going?
- Don't be scared.

193
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,767
Back off. Back off!

194
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,801
- Don't get close.
- Oooh.

195
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:16,470
Oops.

196
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:20,006
Feisty one.
You can't get away now.

197
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,615
Don't!

198
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:41,231
Get him!

199
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:47,805
Ooh!

200
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,544
Ahhh!

201
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,816
W-wait. Wait, wait. OK.

202
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:07,388
Huh! Ha! Ha!

203
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,057
Ha! Hah! Hah!

204
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:12,493
Dok! Dok! Dook! Doo! Oh.

205
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,901
Wah!

206
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,636
Ah! Ahh-aah! Ow!

207
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:25,242
Ow! Ugh! Ow!

208
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:28,544
Ya!

209
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,620
Who you think you are?
Jackie Chan?

210
00:42:44,526 --> 00:42:45,963
Hey!

211
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:53,801
Ahh!

212
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,243
Come on!

213
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:05,779
Get after them!

214
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,017
- I think I'm blind.
- Don't let that bitch slip away!

215
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,986
Stop running!

216
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:34,107
I'll get you!
You broke my balls!

217
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:42,116
This way, boys! Let's get 'em!

218
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,350
Thank you.

219
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:52,722
You're welcome.

220
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:25,618
Hey.

221
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,522
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a performer here.

222
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:31,191
A performer?
They're in rehearsal right now.

223
00:45:31,193 --> 00:45:33,259
The performance
is in the evenings.

224
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:35,895
I need to see him right now.
It's urgent.

225
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:38,999
I'm sorry, I can't let you in
without a permit.

226
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,734
- OK, thank you.
- OK? OK.

227
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:46,272
So, yeah, two for one.

228
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:48,209
Hi.

229
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:51,245
Hey, guys.
Uh, she's my girlfriend.

230
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,214
- Can she come in?
- Yeah, she'll be right.

231
00:45:54,216 --> 00:45:56,049
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

232
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:59,086
Hey-hey, baby!
OK.

233
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,225
My girlfriend.

234
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:07,026
My girlfriend!

235
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:08,828
My girlfriend.

236
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,533
My girlfriend!

237
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,259
Hi. Hey.

238
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:03,552
- Mohammed Salaami.
- Oh.

239
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:09,725
Sorry.

240
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,779
Mohammed Salaami?

241
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:34,915
Sal-ah-meh. Yeah, I'm Salaami.
Salaami. Salaami.

242
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:37,984
- Salaami!
- Good! I'm glad I found you.

243
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:39,886
- W-wh-wh...
- I need you to come with me.

244
00:47:39,888 --> 00:47:42,156
- Where are we going?
- I need you to fix some lights.

245
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:43,894
OK, OK, OK.

246
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,701
OK, everybody,
let's start rehearsal.

247
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:58,439
Lights, music, get ready.

248
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,109
OK, ready?
Action.

249
00:48:03,111 --> 00:48:04,678
Ladies and gentlemen,

250
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,946
please welcome Mr Cosentino.

251
00:48:06,948 --> 00:48:09,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're about

252
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:11,454
to see here tonight
is truly extraordinary.

253
00:48:12,988 --> 00:48:15,723
My angel has arrived.

254
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:17,258
Come to me.

255
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:33,676
Sit down.

256
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:54,627
You were a fallen angel.

257
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:58,564
But God has
given you a second life.

258
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:02,468
I know all your pain.

259
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,406
I'll guide you
through the darkness

260
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:08,709
to the light,

261
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:12,446
and find the soul
that belongs to you.

262
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,683
Love is all around you.

263
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:43,410
No! No!

264
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:46,913
Everybody get out!

265
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,754
Stop!

266
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,626
Don't kill the innocent people.

267
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,163
Hey! I got this!

268
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:14,607
You are late.

269
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,381
My work here is done.

270
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,921
Put your weapons down!
Get on the ground!

271
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:14,436
Get him.

272
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,826
Kill him.

273
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:12,060
Pick me up at the entrance.

274
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,203
You know, you're really starting
to piss me off.

275
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:25,973
Give me back my daughter.

276
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:27,674
You want her?

277
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:29,646
She's all yours, Daddy.

278
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,634
Ohhh! Oh!

279
00:55:57,785 --> 00:56:00,389
Sorry.

280
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:30,052
Yaaah!

281
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,923
Yaaaah!

282
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:42,170
Hello?

283
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:46,008
Hello?

284
01:00:54,515 --> 01:00:56,351
H...

285
01:03:13,254 --> 01:03:15,721
She must be protected.

286
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:20,225
All my work is in her body.

287
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,194
Someday she'll be the proof
to the world

288
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:24,397
of my contribution to mankind.

289
01:04:53,888 --> 01:04:56,858
Oh.

290
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:31,827
Trust me.

291
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,562
Hello.

292
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:45,670
All my work is in her body.

293
01:10:45,672 --> 01:10:48,474
Every detail is recorded
in her blood.

294
01:10:48,476 --> 01:10:50,076
She must be protected.

295
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:52,411
Someday she'll be the proof
to the world

296
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:54,279
of my contribution to mankind.

297
01:13:05,145 --> 01:13:06,447
Ugh!

298
01:13:18,126 --> 01:13:20,995
I don't have time for this.

299
01:16:18,205 --> 01:16:20,275
Good afternoon.
May I help you?

300
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,949
Please wait a minute.

301
01:16:44,998 --> 01:16:47,601
Thank you. This way, please.

302
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:54,234
No, no, no, no!
Bastard!

303
01:20:04,565 --> 01:20:06,631
<i>Such superior
regeneration ability</i>

304
01:20:06,633 --> 01:20:09,902
<i>is attributed to the activation
of the regenerative genes</i>

305
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:12,371
<i>from the starfish.</i>

306
01:20:12,373 --> 01:20:15,607
<i>Each recombined cell contains
the entire genome</i>

307
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:17,442
<i>and fuses to other tissues</i>

308
01:20:17,444 --> 01:20:20,746
<i>to rapidly regrow
the missing part.</i>

309
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:23,148
<i>The experimental subject
is a special force</i>

310
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:26,684
<i>exposed to heavy
nuclear radiation.</i>

311
01:20:26,686 --> 01:20:28,886
<i>He'll become the first
biowarrior in the world</i>

312
01:20:28,888 --> 01:20:30,592
<i>if the experiment succeeds.</i>

313
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,116
<i>We have developed
the first-generation</i>

314
01:20:58,118 --> 01:21:00,152
<i>mechanical heart to match</i>

315
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:03,455
<i>the rapid regeneration feature
of the bioengineered blood.</i>

316
01:21:03,457 --> 01:21:05,924
<i>If the experiment succeeds,
the bioroid,</i>

317
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:08,327
<i>with the mechanical heart
and the bioengineered blood,</i>

318
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:11,466
<i>will be the immortal warrior
of the future.</i>

319
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,736
Yes, madam.

320
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,661
Hey, boss, they're back.

321
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:59,406
You and I
are actually the same.

322
01:23:01,074 --> 01:23:05,412
We're lab rats
in his little experiments.

323
01:23:08,748 --> 01:23:13,184
Ah, the only difference is
you didn't get to experience

324
01:23:13,186 --> 01:23:15,589
the pain that I've suffered.

325
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:20,892
That sly fox.

326
01:23:20,894 --> 01:23:24,699
Hiding his life's work
inside of you.

327
01:23:29,302 --> 01:23:34,309
And all these years
just to find you.

328
01:23:36,877 --> 01:23:40,312
I feel like you've turned me
into a monster.

329
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:08,673
<i>Diverter initiated.</i>

330
01:24:08,675 --> 01:24:10,677
<i>Purification in process.</i>

331
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,997
Who are you? Oh...

332
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,100
We have the same
mechanical heart.

333
01:24:36,102 --> 01:24:39,640
But I'm getting eaten alive
by my own cells.

334
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:43,774
Thanks to Dr James's blood,

335
01:24:43,776 --> 01:24:46,344
not only will I get
my powers back

336
01:24:46,346 --> 01:24:51,950
but your blood will give me
the ability to regenerate.

337
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:55,754
The world's first
super biowarrior.

338
01:24:55,756 --> 01:25:00,828
My blood contains two sets
of memories for 13 years.

339
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,728
Those painful memories

340
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,135
constantly tortured me
day by day.

341
01:25:09,803 --> 01:25:14,107
You will have three memories
once I pass them on to you.

342
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:18,980
And believe me,
you will go insane.

343
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:22,182
No.

344
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:25,649
You see this diverter here?

345
01:25:25,651 --> 01:25:29,254
It'll remove all the impurities
in your blood.

346
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:33,194
Never again will I experience
any more pain.

347
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:11,161
Where's the Asian girl?

348
01:26:11,163 --> 01:26:13,767
- In... inside the lab.
- Open the door.

349
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:26,079
What are you guys doing?

350
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:30,648
- Nancy.
- Where do you think you're going?

351
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,117
- Arrgh!
- Shaun! Sound the alarm!

352
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:35,789
Get outta here! Go, go, go, go!

353
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:39,491
Nancy! Nancy!

354
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:42,062
Nan... Oh!

355
01:26:43,931 --> 01:26:45,732
Nancy.

356
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,600
- Nancy.
- Nancy!

357
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:51,771
Nancy!

358
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,041
Arrgh!

359
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:32,313
